**Motorcycle Night Ride** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 200 images with 10697 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *rider*, *my bike*, *road*, and other: *undrivable*, *lane mark*, and *moveable*.

Images in the Motorcycle Night Ride dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">ACME Technologies Ltd., Bangladesh</span>.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
