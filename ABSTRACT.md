The **Motorcycle Night Ride Dataset** is a collection of 200 frames taken from open media available on YouTube to enable testing for object detection and/or mobility-centered AI solutions - especially on motorcycle helmets with computer vision or other inventive avenues. Developing a dataset can be challenging given the cost of collection and labeling. Acme AI recognizes this bottleneck and is therefore creating open datasets for AI researchers, enthusiasts, and start-ups - enabling them to test their ideas. 

Source data was collected from open media - particularly a video of the WatermelonMotoHead channel on YouTube. This particular dataset was a night scene named [Harley Davidson 48 Night Ride](https://youtu.be/c9DvUbl-wXo) which is based on a cruise in Tucson, Arizona, USA. The dataset is captured during night-time and therefore is subject to artifacts. The authors have used [SuperAnnotateâ€™s pixel editor](https://doc.superannotate.com/) as the tool for the semantics segmentation. It works on a raster logic as opposed to a vector one. Exporting includes the COCO format. They have prepackaged the dataset inclusive of fused images.
